SMASUpdater (v1.6.0)

The SMASUpdater is a tool to update the episode before launching SMBX2.

To use the updater, put everything into the main SMBX2 folder.

To upgrade from your previous SMASUpdater installation to v1.5.0, move the PortableGit folder from the worlds folder to the SMBX2 folder.

(For versions below v1.5.0, put PortableGit (Or download it at https://git-scm.com/download/win ) in the worlds folder, and the bat files in the main SMBX2 folder)

That's all you need to do. Then you can launch either one, and from there you can download SMAS++.

It also has capabilities to run SMBX2.exe afterward when pressing 1 and enter (or 2 to not launch), and it shows you if there are any Git errors before launching.

There are also settings regarding file management, where you can refresh the episode if downloading problems occur, or refresh everything, and move saves back from those options. Settings should be accessible from the main menu.
