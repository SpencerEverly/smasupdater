SMASUpdater (v1.2.0)

The SMASUpdater is a tool to update the episode before launching SMBX2.

To use the updater, put PortableGit (Or download it at https://git-scm.com/download/win ) in the worlds folder, and the bat files in the main SMBX2 folder.

That's all you need to do. Then you can launch either one, and from there you can download SMAS++.

It also has capabilities to run SMBX2.exe afterward when pressing 1 and enter (or 2 to not launch), and it shows you if there are any Git errors before launching.

There's also an minimal version that can automatically start downloading with a click of the program (smasupdater_autoupdate.bat). You can use that if you wanna skip straight to downloading (And it closes automatically, so you can use Task Scheduler to auto update every hour if you want to, it's your call).
